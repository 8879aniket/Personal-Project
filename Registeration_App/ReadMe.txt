This is a project for Registeration of Employee using JavaScript,
NodeJs,Express and MongoDB.
For Front side I used HTML and JavaScript, for Backend I used 
Express with the help of NodeJs Runtime Environment.
There is a index.html in Client Folder open it on browser for 
Registeration action.
Start the Server using nodeom app.js command.
The flow Of data is going from client side to server using 
REST ful service.
When you insert one employee detail please refresh the browser 
to see the changes in the table which is comming from backend.
You can search the employee using FirstName,LastName and 
EmailID also.
ThankYou.
